## general about-me
i'm some undergraduate student pursuing data science (considering aiming for a public health focus). i love to tinker, and though i still have a lot to learn, i love to see what i can make computers do. 
a while ago i decided it'd be a good idea to create a personal github account for projects i wanted to pursue outside of serious work, and i'm trying to be better about maintaining this space. i am working on many projects simultaneously; most stuff here is a work in progress. 
i love long walks, tea, 2000s electronic music, and a rotating assortment of indie games and science fiction. 

**[4/28/2025]** the repositories here are so out of date lol
- i have ideas i've been cooking, code that i've been working on, and changes i still need to push. 
- many projects are never intended to be 100% completed and are intended more as safe spaces for me to practise my skills. that's okay. 

## assorted fun facts
- there was a point where i was the top listener on last.fm for both stephen j. kroos and basic perspective.
- i hate condiments. 
- my internet friend and i doxxed one another (benevolently) and then followed each other on linkedin.
- my full name is ten words long, and my last name is an anglicisation and not a real word.
- my favourite musical mode is e-flat mixolydian or a-flat dorian. 
- people keep texting a middle aged lady named edith when they intend to text me. 
-  i experience auditory hallucinations after two consecutive allnighters.
-  i know that pisslorgulus is a number.
- a british guy could tell i have a southern accent but american people can't. 
- in ninth or tenth grade i almost got left at a gas station in the middle of nowhere at a cross country meet. at night. 
    - i also ran 2/3rds of a state meet with one shoe on. 
- celsius (the drink) smells like gasoline to me. 
- my favourite microwave meal is the saffron road chicken enchiladas al chipotle.
