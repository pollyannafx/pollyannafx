## general about-me
i'm some undergraduate student pursuing data science (considering aiming for a public health focus). i love to tinker, and though i still have a lot to learn, i love to see what i can make computers do. 
a while ago i decided it'd be a good idea to create a personal github account for projects i wanted to pursue outside of serious work, and i'm trying to be better about maintaining this space. i am working on many projects simultaneously; most stuff here is a work in progress. 
i love long walks, tea, 2000s electronic music, and a rotating assortment of indie games and science fiction. 

the two pinned respositories are the two i'm the least embarrassed about. 

## some disclaimers
- i have ideas i've been cooking, code that i've been working on, and changes i still need to push. 
- many projects are never intended to be 100% completed and are intended more as safe spaces for me to practise my skills. that's okay.
- any projects that become good candidates for wholly serious portfolio work will probably be transferred to my account under my real name.
